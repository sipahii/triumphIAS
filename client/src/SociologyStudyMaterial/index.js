                  Dear Aspirants,
                  <br />
                  As far as Study Material for Preparation of Sociology Optional is concerned, Four <strong>NCERT</strong> Books and Select <strong>IGNOU</strong> Booklets provide with all topical Content. Beyond these books you need to develop applied understanding of Sociological Concepts, Theories and Facts. Online Websites contain lots of free study-material for Sociology Optional subject. But not all the study material are relevant. Students should be very selective in referring these study material.<br />
                  Always Remember, there are <strong>LIMITED NUMBER of THEORIES & THINKERS In SOCIOLOGY OPTIONAL PAPERS. CONCEPTS & FACTS are also limited. UPSC-IAS ASPIRANTS</strong> simply need to Read & Understand these <strong>CONCEPTS, THINKERS & SOCIAL FACTS</strong> and <strong>REGULARLY</strong> do <strong>BRAINSTORMING ON PREVIOUS YEAR QUESTIONS.</strong> Every <strong>INDIVIDUAL</strong> has <strong>SOCIOLOGICAL IMAGINATION.</strong> While Preparing for this subject and writing Answers you should simply colour your Sociological Imaginations with Concepts & Theories propounded by <strong>SOCIOLOGICAL THINKERS.</strong><br />
                  Application of Theory and Concepts with reference to <strong>CURRENT SOCIAL FCTS</strong> are common type of analytical writing assigned in <strong>SOCIOLOGY CLASSES</strong> and T<strong>ESTS @ TRIUMPH IAS (Vikash Ranjanâ€™s Classes).</strong> UPSC Evaluators expect you to apply <strong>SOCIOLOGICAL THEORIES</strong> (sometimes called "perspectives" or "arguments") to empirical phenomena called <strong>SOCIAL FACTS.</strong> This is my small effort to combine everything at one place. Happy Reading. For any Doubt in Understanding Sociological Concepts and Facts, feel free to <strong>Call or WhatSapp 8586861046</strong><br />
                  <strong> All the Best !</strong><br />
                  <strong> Vikash Ranjan.</strong><br />
